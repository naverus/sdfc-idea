# Iterum website setup

The website is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/), if you want to run the website it is required ruby, and I would like to suggest a linux environment.

## Install rvm (https://rvm.io/)
``` bash
  gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
  \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
  source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```  
## Install ruby
``` bash
  $ rvm install ruby
  $ rvm use ruby
``` 
## Install Jekyll gem
``` bash
  gem install jekyll
```
## Start Jekyll server
Go to website repository folder, and execute
``` bash
  jekyll serve -w
```
Open the url: http://localhost:4000 on a browser

Start changing the .md files, and refresh the browser in order to see changes
